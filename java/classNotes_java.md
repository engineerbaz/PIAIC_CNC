# Class Notes JAVA

*Var - Variable* is like a box for storing data like 
- String ( Text) 
- Numeric (Number)
- Boolen (True/False)

Key notes for assigning variable names

- should be unique
- Should be started with character, not numeric
- common _keywords_ can not be used like 
  - input
  - let
  - print
  - etc
- its not case sensitive, but best practice is use small letter or cronical type `myName`

Variables are defined as:

```java
var myName;
myName = "Asad";
var myLastName = "Ali";
// also `let` can be used
let age = 30;
var isRegistered = true;
var fullName;

```

Now we can work on above mentioned `variables`

```JAVA
fullName = myName + lastName
Age of fullName is age;
console.log = (age);


```
